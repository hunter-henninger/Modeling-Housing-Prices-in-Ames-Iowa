    "This model is conclusive in that it provides statistically significant evidence of predictive power regarding house prices at sale in Ames, Iowa. Therefore, with new data, this model can predict the price at sale of a house in Ames, Iowa with 90% accuracy. Although this model performs relatively well, the results are restricted by a limited dataset focused on only one city between the years 2006 and 2010. An interesting study to extend this experiment would be to collect data on the exact same list of features for a different city in the United States and apply this model. Comparing the R-squared value and coefficients could lead to profound insight into house prices at sale. Collecting more recent data on homes in Ames would also provide insight into how the effect on sale prices have changed over time.\n",
